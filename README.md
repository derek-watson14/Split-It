# Split-It
Small web app designed to make it easier for my girlfriend and I to determine when we owe each other money.

Prior to creating this we could keep track of when we bought things by going through at the end of the month and calculating everything on paper.
From rent to bills to plane tickets. Now it can be quickly done on this app and we can get back to even (apart from gifts and things of course)!

Not designed to store information long term, nor to be particularly secure, hence use of local storage in the browser to store data.

### This was mostly an exercise to practice DOM manipulation in Vanilla Javascript!
